# WhatsApp Invoice Integration Guide

Your POS system now automatically sends invoices to customers via WhatsApp after completing a sale! This integration uses the Kwikengage API to deliver professional invoice messages directly to the customer's WhatsApp number.

## 🚀 How It Works

3. **Enter customer details** in the popup form (name, phone number, email, address)
4. **Submit the form** → Sale is completed
5. **WhatsApp invoice is automatically sent** to the customer's phone number

### What Gets Sent:
The customer receives a beautifully formatted WhatsApp message containing:
- 🧾 Invoice number and date
- 👤 Customer name
- 📍 Store location
- 📦 Itemized list of products with quantities, prices, and discounts
- 💰 Subtotal, GST breakdown (CGST/SGST/IGST), and total
- 💳 Payment method

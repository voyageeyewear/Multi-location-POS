# Railway WhatsApp PDF Invoice Setup Guide

## üéØ **Problem**
WhatsApp PDF invoices won't be delivered if `BACKEND_URL` is not configured, because Kwikengage needs a public URL to download the PDF files.

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Configure Railway Environment Variables**

### **Step 1: Open Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Open your project: **Multi-location POS**
3. Click on your service (backend)
4. Click on **"Variables"** tab

---

### **Step 2: Add Required Environment Variables**

Add the following variable if not already present:

#### **BACKEND_URL**
- **Name:** `BACKEND_URL`
- **Value:** `https://multi-location-pos-production.up.railway.app`
- **Purpose:** Provides public URL for WhatsApp to download PDF invoices

#### **Other Required Variables** (verify these exist):

| Variable Name | Value | Purpose |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Sets production mode |
| `SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN` | `your-store.myshopify.com` | Shopify store domain |
| `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` | Shopify API access |
| `KWIKENGAGE_API_KEY` | `your_kwikengage_api_key_here` | WhatsApp API key |

---

### **Step 3: Redeploy**

After adding `BACKEND_URL`:
1. Railway will automatically trigger a redeploy
2. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for success

---

### **Step 4: Test WhatsApp PDF Delivery**

1. Open your Railway app: `https://multi-location-pos-production.up.railway.app`
2. Login and complete a sale with a customer phone number
3. Check WhatsApp - you should receive:
   - ‚úÖ Template message with invoice details
   - ‚úÖ PDF document attachment

---

## üîç **Verify Configuration**

### **Check Backend Logs**

In Railway logs, you should see:
```
üì± Attempting to send WhatsApp invoice MUMBVOYA-00005 to +919891065456
‚úÖ WhatsApp template sent successfully!
üìÑ Generating PDF invoice...
‚úÖ PDF generated successfully: MUMBVOYA-00005.pdf
üìé Sending PDF via WhatsApp...
üìÑ Document URL: https://multi-location-pos-production.up.railway.app/api/invoices/MUMBVOYA-00005.pdf
‚úÖ PDF sent successfully!
```

### **If PDF Fails**

Look for these errors in logs:
- ‚ùå `Document URL: http://localhost:8000/...` ‚Üí `BACKEND_URL` not set
- ‚ùå `404 Not Found` ‚Üí Backend not serving PDF files correctly
- ‚ùå `Kwikengage error` ‚Üí API key or template issues

---

## üì± **Local Development (ngrok required)**

For localhost testing, you need ngrok:

### **Setup ngrok**
1. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. Install authtoken:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
   ```
3. Start ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
4. Copy HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)
5. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   BACKEND_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
   ```
6. Restart backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm start
   ```

---

## üöÄ **Production Recommendation**

**For production, always use Railway URL**, not ngrok:
- ‚úÖ Permanent URL
- ‚úÖ No auth required
- ‚úÖ Better performance
- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL/HTTPS

---

## üéâ **Expected Result**

After configuration, when a sale is completed:

### **Customer Receives:**
1. **WhatsApp Template Message**
   ```
   Hi [Customer Name],
   
   Thank you for your purchase!
   
   Invoice: MUMBVOYA-00005

   Amount: ‚Çπ1532.82
   Payment: cash
   
   Your order has been confirmed.
   
   For queries, contact us.
   ```

2. **PDF Invoice Attachment**
   - Professional invoice matching admin panel preview
   - Company details, GST info, itemized list
   - Bank details and declaration
   - High-quality HTML-to-PDF conversion

---

## üìû **Support**

If issues persist:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test Kwikengage API key with a simple message first
4. Ensure customer phone numbers include country code (+91)

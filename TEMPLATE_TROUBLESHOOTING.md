# WhatsApp Template Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Current Issue

The new template `invoice_with_pdf_kiosk` shows as **APPROVED** in the UI, but WhatsApp messages are not being delivered when using it.

---

## ‚úÖ Temporary Solution (ACTIVE NOW)

**I've reverted to the old working template: `invoice_notification_kiosk`**

- ‚úÖ WhatsApp messages will work again
- ‚ùå PDF will NOT be attached (24-hour window limitation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a temporary fix until the new template is fully activated

**Railway is deploying this fix now (~2 minutes)**

## üîç Why the New Template Isn't Working

Even though the template shows as "APPROVED" in the Kwikengage UI, it might not be:

1. **Fully activated in Meta's system** (can take 1-24 hours after approval)
2. **Synced with Kwikengage's API** (backend systems need to update)
3. **Available for your account** (permissions/settings issue)

---

## üìã Steps to Activate the New Template

### Step 1: Contact Kwikengage Support

Send them this message:

```
Hi Kwikengage Support,

I recently created and got approval for a new WhatsApp template:
- Template Name: invoice_with_pdf_kiosk
- Status: APPROVED (in UI)
- Issue: Template not working via API

The template shows as approved in your dashboard, but when I try to use it via API, messages are not being delivered.

Can you please:
1. Confirm the template is fully activated in your backend systems
2. Verify it's available for API use
3. Check if there's any delay in Meta's activation
4. Provide the correct template_id I should use in API calls

Current template structure:
- Header: DOCUMENT type
- Body: 5 text parameters
- Language: English
- Category: UTILITY

Please let me know when the template is fully ready for API use.

Thank you!
```

### Step 2: Test in Kwikengage Dashboard

Before using the API, test the template directly in Kwikengage:

1. Go to **Templates** section
2. Find `invoice_with_pdf_kiosk`
3. Click **"Send Test Message"** (if available)
4. Try sending it to your own WhatsApp number
5. If test works, the template is ready for API use

### Step 3: Check Template ID

Sometimes the template ID in API is different from the name:

1. In Kwikengage dashboard, click on `invoice_with_pdf_kiosk`
2. Look for:
   - Template ID
   - Template Code
   - API Name
3. Make sure we're using the correct identifier

### Step 4: Wait for Activation (if needed)

WhatsApp templates can take time to activate:

- **UI Approval**: Instant (shows green "APPROVED")
- **API Activation**: Can take 1-24 hours
- **Meta Sync**: Sometimes requires 24-48 hours

## üß™ How to Test When Template is Ready

Once Kwikengage confirms the template is ready:

1. **Update the code** (I'll do this):
   ```javascript
   template_id: "invoice_with_pdf_kiosk"  // Switch back
   ```

2. **Test on Railway**:
   - Complete a sale on production
   - Check WhatsApp for message with PDF

3. **Expected Result**:
   - Single message with PDF attached at top
   - Invoice details below the PDF
   - Professional and complete

## üí° Current Workaround Options

### Option 1: Use Old Template (CURRENT)
- ‚úÖ Messages work
- ‚ùå No PDF attachment
- ‚è±Ô∏è Until new template is activated

### Option 2: Wait for Activation
- Check with Kwikengage support
- Could be ready in a few hours
- Full PDF support when ready

### Option 3: Two-Step Process (if needed)
- Send template message (working)
- Send PDF as follow-up (requires customer reply within 24 hours)
- Not ideal, but works as backup
